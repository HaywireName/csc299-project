## 2025-10-17 Outline a Project and a Concepts study plan 

### (User)

I'm looking to build a web application project that uses Python and takes a pdf or docx as input, and has the ability to read the pdf aloud alongside a chatbot for summarizations and questions. 
The program should:
 - display the pdf with page controls, selecting only one page at a time
 - store the pdf on the back-end so it can be pulled up whenever the webpage is reloaded
 - Use popular AI voices that are known for their fluency in narration
 - Have a voiceover of the body-text only with playback controls
 - A chatbot that shows you the summary of the current section you're on, with a prompt for any questions or other summarizations
 - The voiceover and pdf viewer should work together to highlight only the current word on the PDF that is being read-aloud, and moving with the same pace as the voiceover whether forwarding or rewinding or pausing  

Help me outline this program and compartmentalize each portion such as front-end, which features will be back-end, and the process of how I should prompt Claude Code.  

### (Claude AI)

#### **Implementation Strategy for Claude Code**  

**Phase 1: Text Processing**  
```
Prompt: "Create a Python FastAPI backend with endpoints for:
1. File upload (PDF/DOCX) with storage
2. Text extraction from uploaded documents
3. Basic document retrieval by ID
Include proper error handling and file validation."
```

**Phase 2: Text Processing**
```
Prompt: "Add text processing capabilities:
1. Extract body text only (ignore headers/footers)
2. Create page-by-page text segmentation
3. Generate word-level position mapping for PDFs
4. Store processed data in JSON format"
```

**Phase 3: TTS Integration**
```
Prompt: "Integrate OpenAI TTS API:
1. Generate audio for each page of text
2. Implement word-level timestamp generation
3. Create caching system for generated audio
4. Add endpoint to retrieve audio with timing data"
```

**Phase 4: Frontend Base**
```
Prompt: "Create a React frontend with:
1. PDF viewer using react-pdf
2. File upload component
3. Page navigation controls
4. Basic layout with PDF display area and sidebar for chat"
```

**Phase 5: Audio Player**
```
Prompt: "Add audio playback features:
1. Custom audio player with controls
2. Integration with backend audio endpoints
3. Synchronization system between audio timestamp and word highlighting
4. WebSocket connection for real-time updates"
```

**Phase 6: Word Highlighting**
```
Prompt: "Implement PDF word highlighting:
1. Overlay system for highlighting words on PDF
2. Smooth transitions between words
3. Synchronization with audio playback
4. Handle seek, pause, and speed changes" 
```

**Phase 7: AI Integration**
```
Prompt: "Add AI chatbot functionality:
1. Backend endpoints for summarization and Q&A
2. Integration with OpenAI/Claude API
3. Context-aware responses based on current page
4. Frontend chat interface with message history"
```

**Phase 8: Polish and Optimization**
```
Prompt: "Optimize the application:
1. Add proper error handling and loading states
2. Implement caching strategies
3. Add user session management
4. Improve UI/UX with animations and transitions"
```

#### **Key Technical Considerations**

1. **Word-Audio Alignment:** The most challenging aspect. Consider using tools like gentle or aeneas for forced alignment, or use TTS APIs that provide word-level timestamps.
2. **Performance:** Cache generated audio and summaries. Use CDN for static assets.
3. **Scalability:** Consider using cloud storage (S3) and implementing background job queues (Celery) for processing.
4. **State Management:** Use Redux or Zustand for complex frontend state.
5. **Real-time Sync:** WebSockets are crucial for smooth highlighting synchronization.

This modular approach allows you to build and test each component independently, making the development process more manageable and debuggable.

### (User)

That looks like a great outline. I'm a beginner in programming, and would like to know what concepts I should learn more about in order to keep up with Claude Code's process. Create a 2-3 week study plan for the concepts I should look more into.

### (Claude AI)

I'll condense study topics into an intensive 2-3 week plan focusing on the absolute essentials you need to work effectively with Claude Code on this project.

#### Accelerated 2-3 Week Study Plan

**Evening (1.5 hours):**
- **API Fundamentals**
  - Watch: "APIs Explained in 5 minutes"
  - Practice: Use browser to visit a JSON API endpoint (like `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1`)
  - Understand: GET (retrieve) vs POST (send) requests

**Quick Exercise:** Install Postman and make 3 API calls to JSONPlaceholder

##### **Days 3-4: Python Backend Essentials (3-4 hours)**
**Focus Areas:**
- **FastAPI Crash Course**
  - Watch: "FastAPI in 30 minutes" tutorial
  - Understand: Routes (`@app.get("/")`) and functions
  - Learn: How to receive files and return JSON

- **File Handling Basics**
  - Reading/writing files in Python

2. `POST /echo` - returns whatever text you send it

##### **Days 5-7: React Fundamentals (4-5 hours)**
**Compressed React Learning:**
- **Day 5: Components and Props (1.5 hours)**
  - Think: Components = reusable pieces of UI
  - Watch: "React Props in 10 minutes"
  - Understand: Parent → Child data flow

- **Day 6: State and useEffect (2 hours)**
  - `useState`: Data that changes (like current page number)
  - `useEffect`: Run code when things happen (like fetching data on load)
  - Watch: "useState and useEffect explained simply"

- **Day 7: Putting it Together (1.5 hours)**
  - How to fetch data from an API in React
  - How to display that data

**Quick Exercise:** Build a React component that:
1. Fetches a joke from a public API
2. Displays it

- **When needed**: Real-time updates (like highlighting words as audio plays)
- **Basic pattern**:
  ```javascript
  // Frontend listens for updates
  socket.on('wordHighlight', (wordIndex) => {
    // Highlight that word
  });
  ```

**Quick Exercise:** Follow Socket.io's "Getting Started" - just the chat app part (1 hour)

- Complete Weeks 1-2

**Option B: Moderate (3 weeks)**
- 1-2 hours per day
- Complete Weeks 1-2 + selected Week 3 topics

##### **Daily Routine:**
**30 minutes**: Watch/read one tutorial
**30 minutes**: Try the concept hands-on
**30 minutes**: Work on that day's exercise
**30 minutes** (optional): Review and take notes

#### Essential Concepts Cheat Sheet

##### **Must Understand:**
1. **Frontend makes requests → Backend responds**
2. **APIs are just URLs that return data instead of web pages**
3. **React components are like LEGO blocks**
4. **State = data that changes**
5. **useEffect = do something when X happens**
6. **Async = don't freeze while waiting**
7. **WebSockets = real-time, two-way communication**

#### **Claude Code Interaction Strategy:**

##### **Week 1 - While Learning Basics:**
Ask Claude Code to:
- "Explain what this code does step by step"
- "Add comments to each section"
- "What does this error mean?"

##### **Week 2 - While Building:**
Ask Claude Code to:
- "Create a simple version of [feature] first"
- "Break this into smaller functions"
- "Show me just the API endpoint for [specific task]"

##### **Week 3 - When Integrating:**
Ask Claude Code to:
- "How do these two parts connect?"
- "What data format does this expect?"
- "Can you add error handling here?"

#### Minimum Viable Knowledge

##### **If you only have 1 week, focus on:**
1. **How APIs work** (2 hours)
2. **React components and state** (3 hours)
3. **FastAPI basics** (2 hours)
4. **How to read error messages** (1 hour)
5. **Asking good questions** (practice throughout)

##### **Red Flags - Research these before running code:**
- `api_key = "..."` (should be hidden)
- `while True:` without break conditions
- `eval()` or `exec()` functions
- SQL queries with user input directly inserted

#### Key Resources for Fast Learning

##### **Video Crash Courses (YouTube):**
- "FastAPI in 30 minutes" - Traversy Media
- "React in 30 minutes" - Programming with Mosh
- "WebSockets in 30 minutes" - Fireship

##### **Interactive (Learning by Doing):**
- **React**: Scrimba's free React course (first 2 hours)
- **Python**: Codecademy's Python (first 3 lessons)
- **APIs**: Postman's API Learning Center

##### **Documentation (for reference):**
- FastAPI docs (incredibly clear)
- React Quick Start (new React docs)
- MDN Web Docs (for any web concept)

#### Working with Claude Code - Week by Week

#### **Week 1 Approach:**
"I'm new to [concept]. Can you create a simple version and explain each part?"

#### **Week 2 Approach:**
"I understand the basics. Let's build [feature]. Please break it into steps."

#### **Week 3 Approach:**
"How do we connect [component A] with [component B]? What data passes between them?"

#### Remember:
- **You don't need to memorize** - you need to understand concepts
- **Claude Code writes the code** - you direct and understand it
- **Every error is a learning opportunity**
- **Google everything you don't understand** - it's what developers do
- **Start building immediately** - learn as you go

The goal isn't to become an expert in 2-3 weeks, but to know enough to:
1. Understand what Claude Code is building
2. Ask informed questions
3. Spot potential issues
4. Make simple modifications

Start with Day 1, but if you're eager to build, you can start the project alongside your learning after Week 1!
